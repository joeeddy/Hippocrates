## ✨ Vision

Hippocrates the AI sandbox— a philosophical spark in code. Built on principles of decentralized trust, emergent intelligence, and fractal growth, Hippocrates seeks to become a self-learning teacher: one that evolves, expands modularly, and ultimately offers world-class education to anyone, anywhere.

This early version is a minimal, elegant network simulation—a first breath in what will become a generative mind.

## 🧬 How It Works (Current Build)

The system runs a simulation on a 10×10 grid of nodes. Each node:
- 🧠 Holds an internal state (a float between 0 and 1)
- 🤝 Interacts with neighbors (4-directional)
- 🔄 Updates via averaging and mutation
- 📈 Commits state changes in sync with the grid

The simplicity allows emergent behavior from minimal code—think Conway’s Game of Life meets Satoshi’s decentralization ideals.

## 🛠 Technologies & Principles

- **Python** – Clean, modular simulation architecture
- **Fractal Logic** – Designed for recursive expansion
- **Minimal Bias** – Random initialization and neighbor-driven learning
- **Decentralized Thought** – Inspired by Bitcoin’s core ethos: no gatekeepers

## 💡 The Road Ahead

This grid evolves into a frontend/backend intelligence core:
- 🧩 Future modules: learning algorithms, APIs, educational content generators
- 🎓 Final goal: a scalable AI mentor that grows smarter with each conversation
- 🌍 Philosophy: Intelligence should be transparent, teachable, and borderless
