# Hippocrates

A simple, module-free AI inspired by Bitcoin's whitepaper, exhibiting fractal, emergent behavior through a decentralized network of nodes.

## Setup Instructions

1. Create a public GitHub repository named `Hippocrates`:
   - Go to GitHub.com, sign in, and click the “+” icon > “New repository.”
   - Name it `Hippocrates`, select “Public,” and click “Create repository.”
   - Do **not** initialize with a README or LICENSE (you’ll add them manually below).

2. Add the following files to the repository:
   - `main.py`
   - `node.py`
   - `network.py`
   - `README.md` (this file)
   - `LICENSE`
   - For each file: Click “Add file” > “Create new file,” enter the file name, paste the content, and click “Commit new file.”

3. Launch GitHub Codespaces:
   - In the `Hippocrates` repository, click the green “Code” button.
   - Go to the “Codespaces” tab and click “Create Codespaces on main.”
   - Wait for the environment to set up (Python is pre-installed).

4. Run the AI:
   - In the Codespaces terminal, type:
     ```bash
     python main.py
